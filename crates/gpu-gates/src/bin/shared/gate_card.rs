//! The gate plan's card, one owner for both tiers: the real tier plans on the card the gate runner
//! put in view — `workstation::plan_gate`'s machine, the 3090's bytes, so the plan and every pin a
//! gate reads from it are the 3090's — on whichever one card is visible (tools/gpu-gate.sh's pick
//! under `BLOOMERY_GATE_CARD`); the fixture tier plans on `a`, the largest visible card as the
//! device reports itself (`--place a`), its free bytes included. The real tier resolves the card as
//! the gate placement does (`Pick::Room(&RTX_3090)`, a server's `--place gate`): the 3090's total
//! and driver reserve on the device in view, which keeps its own name, identity, allocation granule
//! and whether it shares the host's memory, held as `tier::real_card` holds a census card. On the
//! 3090 the machine is `plan_gate`'s exactly, on any larger card it plans the 3090's usable bytes,
//! and a unified card plans the pool its free reading is. A census of other than one visible card,
//! or a card with less room than the 3090's bytes, is refused by name before any load. A two-card
//! arm plans its own machine with both cards in view and never reads the gate card
//! (`lcpp_e2e::Arm::machine`'s `bp`).
