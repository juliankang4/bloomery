//! What a pass of several rows of Raon-1's body leaves for its commit
//! (`runtime::Verify::commit`), and how the commit takes the rest back.
//!
//! A verify keeps each row's state exactly, where the reference restores a
//! checkpoint and runs the kept ids again (`speculative-simple.cpp`):
//! - an RDA layer's recurrent state has [`PASS_ROWS`] lanes on a load that
//!   verifies, one on a load that does not ([`rda_store`]). A verify's row
//!   `j` writes the state after it into lane `(c + j) mod lanes`
//!   (`linear::delta`'s row mode, `c` the committed lane), so keeping its
//!   first `k` rows moves the lane word to
//!   [`kept_lane`](crate::linear::delta::kept_lane)`(c, k)` and copies
//!   nothing. Row 0 writes lane `c` itself: a verify always keeps its first
//!   row. A step and a prompt chunk run in place on the committed lane;
//! - an RDA layer's conv ring holds the inputs of the last
//!   [`RING_ROWS`](crate::linear::RING_ROWS) positions, each in the slot of
//!   its position, so a call from any kept position reads its predecessors
//!   where the pass left them;
//! - a latent layer's cache is indexed by position and read only below the
//!   live count: a taken-back row is written again by the next call at its
//!   position before any launch reads it. Its length is the body's position.
//!
//! [`Lanes`] is the host's side of the lane word: the committed lane and the
//! verify waiting for its commit. While a verify waits, every other pass is
//! refused by name, since its rows would read a lane the commit has not
//! named.
