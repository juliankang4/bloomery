"""The ptx-shapes name check as a static check (Mac, text only, no build).

    tools/check-ptx-names.py check [--root DIR]
    tools/check-ptx-names.py --self-test

tools/ptx-spill-check.sh holds every entry a pinned binary carries to the row of tools/ref/ptx-shapes.tsv, but
only on the box, after the pinned binaries are built and scanned: a kernel deleted without its row, or added
without one, passed every Mac check and went red inside a landing batch (train0211i, 2026-10-11, carried R5u's
first commit without its pin commit: ds41_ffn_card_acc_10 unpinned, ds41_ffn_places_10_cols, q38_card_acc and
qwen3moe_places stale). This check reads the same two sets from source:

  rows      the table's `<binary> <entry> <spill> <jit_local>` lines;
  declared  the entries the binary's device crates declare, which are the PTX entry names (the table's entries
            are the `fn` names: `_8`, `_10`, `_10_cols` are part of the name, no suffix is generated).

and fails a row no source declares (`stale`) and a declared entry with no row (`unpinned`), per binary:

  <bin> <entry> stale                         (in the table, declared by none of the binary's crates)
  <bin> <entry> unpinned (<file>:<line>)      (declared, not in the table)

Every table the recipe names, one per PTX arch and card capability (an argument that ends in `/` is every
`*.tsv` in that directory, and one with none is a refusal), is checked for stale and unpinned entries:

  <bin> <entry> stale (<table>)               (in that table, declared by none of the binary's crates)
  <bin> <entry> unpinned (<file>:<line>; <table>) (declared for that target, not in that table)

A target-only module may instead be pinned in a target table with a `# cfg: NAME` line,
matching its sibling mod.rs or lib.rs's `#[cfg(NAME)] mod name;` declaration. Its target's
table requires those entries and every unconditional entry; the other tables require only
their own target entries and the unconditional ones. Resource values come from a scan on each target card.

What declares an entry. A `#[kernel]` attribute (its attribute stack may span lines: `#[allow(..)]`,
`#[launch_bounds(..)]`, `#[launch_contract(..)]` and doc lines sit between it and the `fn`) on a line of its own,
not in a comment; the entry is the `fn` that follows. The one generated family is a `macro_rules!` whose kernel
is `fn $name`: each invocation binds the names on its `KEY: a, b, c,` line positionally to the macro's own
pattern line `KEY: $x:ident, $y:ident, $z:ident,` (`sigmoid_router_instance!`, `entries:`: the glm5next and
mimo2 routers). A macro that repeats a group (`quant_sel_module!`, one line a type) matches the same pattern
line inside the repetition, and its invocation repeats the `KEY:` line: every line binds its own names. A `$name` the macro's pattern does not bind, a `#[kernel]` that no `fn` follows,
a kernel under a `#[cfg(..)]` attribute or inside a `#[cfg(test)]` module, and a binary or recipe this file does
not know are each a named refusal, never a skipped entry.

Which tables, binaries and crates. The tables and binaries come from the `gate-ptx-spill` recipe's `ptx-spill-check.sh
tools/ref/ptx-shapes.tsv [<table>...] <bin>[:<substring>]...` call (the one owner of what is pinned); BIN_CRATES
names the device crates each links under the features the recipe builds it with (`generate_ds41`: gpu + deepseek41,
`gate_qwen3vl_tower`: vision = gpu + gpu-vision). A substring after `:` is ptx-scan's own entry
filter: the binary's expected entries are the crates' kernels that hold it. A binary in the recipe or the
table that BIN_CRATES lacks is a refusal that says what to add.

The covered binary. A binary the recipe does not scan, whose kernels the scanned ones carry, is pinned by the premise that
it carries the same device code (COVERED: `gate_e2e`, whose entries are `generate_ds41`'s bloomery-gpu bundle again). The
premise is derived, not listed: from the manifests, by a small resolver
of cargo's feature rules over the workspace's path crates (`dep:`, `crate/feature`, optional dependencies, default
features; a weak `crate?/feature` is a refusal), for the covered binary under its `[[bin]]` `required-features` and for every
scanned binary under the `--features` of its `cargo oxide build` in the recipe. A device crate is a workspace crate whose
source has a `#[kernel]` or `#[cuda_module]` line, or invokes a `macro_rules!` whose body has one. It fails:

  <bin> <crate> not scanned (...)            the covered binary links a device crate no unfiltered scanned binary links (a
                                             binary scanned for the entries holding a substring pins only those entries)
  <bin> <crate> features differ (...)        every scanned binary that links it gives the crate other features
  <bin> <file>:<line> declares a kernel ...  a `#[kernel]` or `#[cuda_module]` in the covered binary's own sources (its
                                             bin file and the modules it names with `mod x;` / `#[path]`), which no
                                             scanned binary compiles

What it cannot see (the box scan still does):
  - which crates a recipe's feature set links, for the scanned binaries' own pins: BIN_CRATES is a map written beside the
    recipe; a feature change that links one more kernel crate into a pinned binary shows on the box as `unpinned` (the
    covered binary's guard above does read the manifests);
  - the covered binary's guard compares the workspace crates' features, not those of an external crate (cuda-*, serde_json),
    code behind `#[cfg(..)]` outside a kernel's own attributes, an `include!` (refused where it names a source of the
    covered binary), or a build of the covered binary with more features than its `required-features` (the recipe never
    scanned one);
  - a macro other than the one bound by a `KEY:` line, a `#[macro_export]` macro invoked from another crate, a
    kernel written by a proc macro (all named refusals where the text shows them, otherwise invisible);
  - the spill and jit_local values (the ratchet's own job) and whether the compiler emits an entry.

Exit: 0 every binary's rows equal its declared entries; 1 a violation or a refusal (printed, one line each, every
binary read before the verdict); 2 a usage error or an unreadable input.
